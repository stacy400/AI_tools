- `task3.ipynb`: Sentiment Analysis and Named Entity Recognition
  - Uses spaCy for NLP processing
  - Implements rule-based sentiment analysis
  - Extracts named entities from product reviews
  - Analyzes Amazon product reviews

## Task 3: Sentiment Analysis Details
The notebook implements:
- Rule-based sentiment analysis using positive/negative word lists

- Processing of product reviews to extract:
  - Sentiment (Positive/Negative/Neutral)
  - Named entities (Products, Brands, etc.)

## Requirements
- Python
- spaCy
- en_core_web_sm (spaCy English model)

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python and required packages installed
